<h1 id="eligibility-guidelines">Eligibility Guidelines</h1>
<p>The guidelines governing eligibility criteria for the 31 benefits programs in the API are maintained and updated on a regular basis by NYC Opportunity in partnership with the benefit program’s administering agency. These guidelines are interpreted and implemented as logic in the eligibility engine which runs on the business rules management system Drools. </p>
<p>It’s important for developers and end-users impacted by use of the API to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of this API do not represent an eligibility determination and do not guarantee eligibility in any program.</li>
<li>Likewise, the absence of a program result for a household should not be taken as an absolute indication of the household’s ineligibility for a program.</li>
<li>To enroll in a benefit or program, a resident will need to submit an application through the administering agency, which will determine eligibility.</li>
<li>The results of this API do not prohibit anyone from applying for any benefits or programs.</li>
</ul>
