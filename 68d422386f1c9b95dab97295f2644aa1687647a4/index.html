      <p>The NYC Benefits Eligibility Application Programing Interface (API) allows you to utilize the engine that governs <a href="https://access.nyc.gov/eligibility/">ACCESS NYC’s Eligibility Screener</a>. This web service allows developers to create modern web applications that evaluate household data (i.e. information about a household’s income, expenses, housing situation, etc.) against eligibility rules for 31 different City, State, and Federal benefits programs. It is built around policies of security, privacy, and reliable service following REST principles.</p>
<p>When household data is sent to the Eligibility API, it will return a JSON response that contains program names and codes. The program codes can be used to cross-reference additional content from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/2j8u-wtju">Benefits and Program’s Open API</a>. These are the same tools that <a href="http://nyc.gov/access">ACCESS NYC</a> and <a href="http://nyc.gov/growingupnyc">Growing Up NYC</a> use to provide content and eligibility information for health and human services.   Now, eligibility rules collected and maintained by the <a href="http://nyc.gov/opportunity">Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity</a><sup>1</sup> can be used with program content (including the most recent applications, eligibility requirements, and application dates) by the public. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits of integration with the NYC Benefits Eligibility API:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Potential eligibility for 31 City, State, and Federal programs (including SNAP, Cash Assistance, WIC, HEAP, and more)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eligibility criteria maintained by NYC Opportunity and participating governmental agencies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How you can use the API:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide a holistic view of your clients’ potential eligibility and suggest appropriate benefits programs for their situation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inform and better targeting for your benefits outreach campaigns (ex: direct marketing mailers and emails, case worker outreach) </p>
</li>
<li><p>For City Agencies, NYC Opportunity can provide access to the API through data sharing CSVs instead of technical integration.  <a href="mailto:eligibilityapi@nycopportunity.nyc.gov">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about NYC Opportunity’s products can be found on nyc.gov/opportunity. This site provides documentation on how to use the API. For direct support, contact us following the guide on the Feedback and Support page.</p>
<p><sup><sup>1</sup>The NYC Benefits Eligibility API is intended to be used as a tool to screen for a household’s potential eligibility for a given program. It is not a guarantee that the household will be found eligible for all or any programs. See <a href="/eligibility-guidelines">Eligibility Guidelines</a> for more details.</sup></p>
