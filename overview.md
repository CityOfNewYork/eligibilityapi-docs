The NYC Benefits Screening Application Programing Interface (the “NYC Benefits Screening API” or “Screening API”) allows you to utilize the rules engine that governs [ACCESS NYC’s Eligibility Screener](https://access.nyc.gov/eligibility/). This web service allows developers to create web applications that evaluate household data (e.g., household income, household expenses, housing situation, etc.) against eligibility rules for 31 different City, State, and Federal benefits programs. The NYC Benefits Screening API is built around policies of security, privacy, and reliable service in accordance with Representational State Transfer (REST) principles, which defines a set of constraints for creating Web Services.

When household data is sent to the Screening API, it will return a response (JSON) that contains program names and codes. These program codes can be used to cross-reference additional content from the [Benefits and Program’s Open API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/kvhd-5fmu). These are the same tools that [ACCESS NYC](http://nyc.gov/accessnyc) and [Growing Up NYC](http://nyc.gov/growingupnyc) use to provide content and eligibility information for health and human services.   With the NYC Benefits Screening API, the eligibility rules collected and maintained by the [Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity](http://nyc.gov/opportunity) can be used with program content (including the most recent applications, eligibility requirements, and application dates) by members of the public.

**Benefits of integrating data using the NYC Benefits Screening API:**

* Assesses potential eligibility for 31 City, State, and Federal programs (including SNAP, Cash Assistance, WIC, HEAP, and more) against criteria maintained by NYC Opportunity and participating governmental agencies

* Provides a holistic view of  clients’ potential eligibility for various benefits and suggests appropriate benefits programs

* Informs and better targets benefits outreach efforts by assessing potential eligibility for specific benefits programs based on existing client data (including through direct outreach mailers and emails, caseworker outreach)

This site provides documentation on how to use the Benefits Screening API. For direct support, contact us following the guide on our Feedback and Support page. For City agencies, NYC Opportunity can also provide access to the API through a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as Comma Separated Values (CSV), instead of technical integration. [Contact us](mailto:screeningapi@nycopportunity.nyc.gov) for more information about the Benefits Screening API. Additional information about NYC Opportunity’s products can be found on [nyc.gov/opportunity](http://nyc.gov/opportunity).

All use of the NYC Benefits Screening API is governed by the [Terms of Service for the NYC Benefits Screening API](terms-of-service), the NYC.gov [Terms of Use](https://www1.nyc.gov/home/terms-of-use.page), and NYC.gov [Privacy Policy](https://www1.nyc.gov/home/privacy-policy.page).
