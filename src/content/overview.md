The NYC Benefits Eligibility Application Programing Interface (API) allows you to utilize the engine that governs [ACCESS NYC’s Eligibility Screener](https://access.nyc.gov/eligibility/). This web service allows developers to create modern web applications that evaluate household data (i.e. information about a household’s income, expenses, housing situation, etc.) against eligibility rules for 31 different City, State, and Federal benefits programs. It is built around policies of security, privacy, and reliable service following REST principles.

When household data is sent to the Eligibility API, it will return a JSON response that contains program names and codes. The program codes can be used to cross-reference additional content from the [Benefits and Program’s Open API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/2j8u-wtju). These are the same tools that [ACCESS NYC](http://nyc.gov/access) and [Growing Up NYC](http://nyc.gov/growingupnyc) use to provide content and eligibility information for health and human services.   Now, eligibility rules collected and maintained by the [Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity](http://nyc.gov/opportunity)<sup>1</sup> can be used with program content (including the most recent applications, eligibility requirements, and application dates) by the public.

**Benefits of integration with the NYC Benefits Eligibility API:**

* Potential eligibility for 31 City, State, and Federal programs (including SNAP, Cash Assistance, WIC, HEAP, and more)

* Eligibility criteria maintained by NYC Opportunity and participating governmental agencies

**How you can use the API:**

* Provide a holistic view of your clients’ potential eligibility and suggest appropriate benefits programs for their situation.

* Inform and better targeting for your benefits outreach campaigns (ex: direct marketing mailers and emails, case worker outreach)

* For City Agencies, NYC Opportunity can provide access to the API through data sharing CSVs instead of technical integration.  [Contact us](mailto:eligibilityapi@nycopportunity.nyc.gov) for more information.

More information about NYC Opportunity’s products can be found on nyc.gov/opportunity. This site provides documentation on how to use the API. For direct support, contact us following the guide on the Feedback and Support page.

<sup><sup>1</sup>The NYC Benefits Eligibility API is intended to be used as a tool to screen for a household’s potential eligibility for a given program. It is not a guarantee that the household will be found eligible for all or any programs. See [Eligibility Guidelines](/eligibility-guidelines) for more details.</sup>
