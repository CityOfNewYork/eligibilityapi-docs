# Request an Account

The Eligibility API requires users to have an account in order to authenticate requests (using an authentication token) to receive successful responses for each endpoint. You can request an account on this page. Each account request is reviewed and it may take some time (please give us 1-2 business days) for your request to be fulfilled. Please keep in mind, by requesting an account, you agree to the terms of service for this API. 

After the account is created, two emails are sent to the address provided. One will contain your temporary developer credentials and the other will contain your temporary production credentials. You should use the developer credentials and domain when testing and developing with the API or in development, testing, or staging environments. The production domain should be used in public facing or production environments.

Once you have credentials you will then use them with the Authentication Endpoint to set your developer and production passwords. Keep in mind; after 30 days the temporary password will expire, you will need to set your developer and production passwords, and you will only be able to set your password once. If, for any reason, you need to reset your password or update your account information please contact us through Support.
